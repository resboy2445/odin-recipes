            <p><em>O thou reader, behold the steps to fashion forth a repast of Jollof Rice, with all its spicy and flavorful delight.</em></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li>Begin by blending in a pot o' sorcery, combining ripe tomatoes, red poblano peppers, chopped onions,
                 and fierce Scotch bonnets, with two cups of stock. Blend until smooth, a minute or two shall suffice, to yield six cups of blended mixture.
                 Pour into a cauldron, bring to boil and then simmer, partly covered, for ten to twelve minutes.</li>
            <li>Take a large skillet and heat oil, then add the sliced onions and season with salt.
                     Fry for two to three minutes and add the bay leaves, curry powder, dried thyme, 
                     and a pinch of black pepper for three to four minutes, with the heat medium. Then add the tomato paste, 
                     and stir for two more minutes. Add the reduced tomato-pepper-Scotch bonnet mixture, stir, 
                     and set the skillet on medium heat for ten to twelve minutes, until reduced by half with the lid partly on. 
                     This shall be the stew that defines the pot.</li>
            <li>To the cooked tomato sauce, add four cups of stock, bring to boil for one to two minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the rinsed rice and a dollop of butter, stir, and cover with a double piece of foil or parchment paper,
                 then place a lid on the skillet. This will seal in the steam and lock in the flavor. 
                Cook on the lowest possible heat for thirty minutes, stirring halfway through.</li>
            <li>Stir the rice and taste, adjusting as needed. If the rice is not soft enough,
                 add a quarter to half a cup of stock or water, stirring through and continue to steam until cooked through.</li>
            <li>If thou wishes, add sliced onions, fresh tomatoes, and another teaspoon of butter, and stir through. 
                Let rest, covered, for five to six minutes.</li>
            <li>To make Party Rice, which is essentially Smoky Jollof Rice, ye must take an additional step.
                 Party Rice is traditionally cooked over an open fire, but the same result can be achieved on the stove top.
                  Heat the skillet, with the lid on, until the rice crackles and snaps, with the aroma of toasted rice. 
                  Turn off the heat and let it rest until ready to serve.
                 The longer the lid stays on, the smokier it shall be. Let the party begin!</li>

        </ol>
